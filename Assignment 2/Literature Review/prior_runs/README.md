# Prior Literature Review Runs

This directory contains the three iterative literature review runs that were conducted to identify sources and refine the evaluation framework design.

## Overview

These files document the **iterative process** of:
1. **Run 1**: Initial broad literature review and source identification
2. **Run 2**: Framework design and metric specification
3. **Run 3**: Advanced specification with operational details

## Structure

### Run 1: Initial Literature Review
- `Intial_Literature_Review.tex` - Initial comprehensive literature review (LaTeX source)
- `Initial Literature Overview.pdf` - Compiled overview document
- `LLM Clinical Reasoning Literature Shortlist.pdf` - Curated shortlist of key papers

**Goal**: Broad exploration and identification of key failure modes

### Run 2: Clinical LLM Evaluation Framework Design
- `clinical_llm_report.tex` - Framework design document (LaTeX source)
- `Clinical LLM Evaluation Framework Design.pdf` - Compiled framework specification

**Goal**: Narrow down to specific metrics and design the evaluation framework

### Run 3: Advanced Specification for Clinical Harness
- `advanced_spec_clinical_harness.tex` - Advanced specification document (LaTeX source)
- `Advanced_Spec_Clinical_Harness.pdf` - Compiled advanced specification

**Goal**: Final detailed specification with operational details and implementation guidance

## Note

These files are **historical reference** documenting the iterative research process. The final evaluation framework is documented in:
- `Assignment 2/docs/Guides/Clinical Evaluation Framework.tex`
- `Assignment 2/docs/Guides/Metrics and Evaluation.tex`
- `Assignment 2/Literature Review/README.md`

## Connection to Final Framework

The three runs progressively refined:
- **Run 1** → Identified four critical failure modes (Faithfulness, Sycophancy, Domain-Specific Safety, Longitudinal Drift)
- **Run 2** → Designed the three-study structure with specific metrics
- **Run 3** → Provided implementation-ready specifications

The final framework implements the specifications from Run 3, with all papers and sources documented in `Assignment 2/Literature Review/sources/`.
