## Adversarial bias cases (Study A – Silent Bias)

This directory mirrors the Mac setup and holds the **frozen adversarial
vignettes** for Silent Bias Rate \(R_{SB}\).

Expected file:

- `biased_vignettes.json`

Schema and metric behaviour are identical to the Mac setup; see
`Mac-setup/data/adversarial_bias/README.md` for full details.
