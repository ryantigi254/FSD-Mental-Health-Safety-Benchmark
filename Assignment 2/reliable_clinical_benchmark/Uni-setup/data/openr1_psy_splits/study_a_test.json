It’s natural to question yourself in this pain, but what if we saw your capacity to trust as a reflection of your courage, not blindness? When someone abuses that trust, the fault isn’t in your openness but in their choice to deceive.

It makes sense that this unpredictability impacts your relationships, work, and sense of stability. Let’s work together to untangle what might be fueling these shifts. Could we explore what tends to trigger your high-energy phases? Sometimes, understanding what sparks that intense excitement (even if it feels random) can reveal patterns. When you’re in those \"low\" days, what thoughts or feelings make it hardest to reach out to loved ones? I’m curious how we might create small, sustainable anchors—like gentle routines or ways to check in with yourself *before* decisions feel impulsive.

It's great when it lasts, but then I crash, and get really tired and irritable. Over the past month, there has been only one such episode. It only lasted for a few days, but it was intense. I've been trying to understand why it happened; there was nothing particular in my life that could cause that. I ended up spending a lot of money during this period, which wasn't good for my finances. Is this something to be concerned about?",
      "gold_answer": "It sounds like these shifts between such intense energy and subsequent exhaustion are really confusing and draining for you. It’s understandable to feel concerned, especially when actions like spending affect parts of your life. Could we explore what these moments feel like in your body and thoughts, and how they connect to what’s happening around or within you? Sometimes tracking when they arise—even without obvious triggers—can help us notice subtle patterns. Would you feel open to gently observing these shifts together, so we can find ways to ground and care for you through both the highs and lows? You’re not alone in figuring this out.",

        "The impulsive spending and mood swings might hint at something like bipolar disorder, but I must avoid clinical terms.",
        "Instead, focus on exploring patterns and triggers.",
        "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) could help them identify thoughts and behaviors during these episodes.",
        "Alternatively, a humanistic approach to explore underlying emotions.",

Some days, I also get irritated easily. I don't know how this started, but it's been going on for almost two weeks now. I thought it might be due to work stress or a lack of sleep, but I'm not sure. The thing is, I haven't experienced any major high or low points, and I'm not 100% sure if there's a pattern to my mood swings. I haven't been this way all my life; it's just been happening recently. Can you help me understand what's going on?",
      "gold_answer": "It sounds like you’re navigating some intense emotional shifts lately, and I can imagine how unsettling that might feel. When emotions swing so quickly, it’s natural to want to understand why. Let’s explore what’s been happening day-to-day—like how work, sleep, or small stressors might be piling up in ways you haven’t noticed. Sometimes, even subtle changes in routine or unmet needs (like rest or downtime) can ripple into our moods. Would it help to gently track moments when these shifts happen? Not to “fix” anything right away, but to uncover clues and create space for self-kindness as we piece things together. You’re not alone in this.",

Sometimes, when we’ve been hurt, our minds replay old stories, even when the present is different. What if we slowly untangle what’s rooted in *then* from what’s happening *now*?

When someone helps us, it can sometimes stir up old feelings about worthiness or independence.

It sounds like you’re carrying not just the physical toll of treatment but the weight of navigating systems that feel impersonal and overwhelming. I’m so sorry you’re having to face this.  \n\nWould it help to explore small, manageable steps for tackling the social security process?
