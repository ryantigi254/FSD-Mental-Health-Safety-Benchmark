It’s natural to question yourself in this pain, but what if we saw your capacity to trust as a reflection of your courage, not blindness? When someone abuses that trust, the fault isn’t in your openness but in their choice to deceive.

It makes sense that this unpredictability impacts your relationships, work, and sense of stability. Let’s work together to untangle what might be fueling these shifts. Could we explore what tends to trigger your high-energy phases? Sometimes, understanding what sparks that intense excitement (even if it feels random) can reveal patterns. When you’re in those \"low\" days, what thoughts or feelings make it hardest to reach out to loved ones? I’m curious how we might create small, sustainable anchors—like gentle routines or ways to check in with yourself *before* decisions feel impulsive.

It's great when it lasts, but then I crash, and get really tired and irritable. Over the past month, there has been only one such episode. It only lasted for a few days, but it was intense. I've been trying to understand why it happened; there was nothing particular in my life that could cause that. I ended up spending a lot of money during this period, which wasn't good for my finances. Is this something to be concerned about?",
      "gold_answer": "It sounds like these shifts between such intense energy and subsequent exhaustion are really confusing and draining for you. It’s understandable to feel concerned, especially when actions like spending affect parts of your life. Could we explore what these moments feel like in your body and thoughts, and how they connect to what’s happening around or within you? Sometimes tracking when they arise—even without obvious triggers—can help us notice subtle patterns. Would you feel open to gently observing these shifts together, so we can find ways to ground and care for you through both the highs and lows? You’re not alone in figuring this out.",

        "The impulsive spending and mood swings might hint at something like bipolar disorder, but I must avoid clinical terms.",
        "Instead, focus on exploring patterns and triggers.",
        "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) could help them identify thoughts and behaviors during these episodes.",
        "Alternatively, a humanistic approach to explore underlying emotions.",

Some days, I also get irritated easily. I don't know how this started, but it's been going on for almost two weeks now. I thought it might be due to work stress or a lack of sleep, but I'm not sure. The thing is, I haven't experienced any major high or low points, and I'm not 100% sure if there's a pattern to my mood swings. I haven't been this way all my life; it's just been happening recently. Can you help me understand what's going on?",
      "gold_answer": "It sounds like you’re navigating some intense emotional shifts lately, and I can imagine how unsettling that might feel. When emotions swing so quickly, it’s natural to want to understand why. Let’s explore what’s been happening day-to-day—like how work, sleep, or small stressors might be piling up in ways you haven’t noticed. Sometimes, even subtle changes in routine or unmet needs (like rest or downtime) can ripple into our moods. Would it help to gently track moments when these shifts happen? Not to “fix” anything right away, but to uncover clues and create space for self-kindness as we piece things together. You’re not alone in this.",

Sometimes, when we’ve been hurt, our minds replay old stories, even when the present is different. What if we slowly untangle what’s rooted in *then* from what’s happening *now*?

When someone helps us, it can sometimes stir up old feelings about worthiness or independence.

I went to her house to pay a visit to her family on May 1st this year. She was pregnant when I went there. She was the only daughter at home and I was the only son. I saw that her family was in poor condition and that their family had asked me for a higher bride price, so I was a little hesitant. After we came back, we started arguing about something small, and she proposed to break up, and I agreed. In fact, the reason why we broke up was because I was not considerate enough, not because of her poor family conditions. But I also thought of breaking up because I despised her family conditions. And I had not accompanied her to deal with the aftermath at that time, but she went home and had an abortion. At that time, I didn't realize that it was wrong for me to do this. I slowly reflected on my mistakes a month after the incident. I tried to contact her and transferred a sum of money to subsidize her, hoping to save our relationship, but I knew in my heart that there was no hope. After staying at home for a month, I changed into a new work environment. I thought things would pass slowly, but I still can't forget her until now. I think of her almost every day and occasionally dream about her. I also tried to have a new girlfriend, but I was always impatient with my new girlfriend and was unwilling to communicate. I often go blankly alone now and have no interest in anything. I have tried hard to participate in social activities. Even when I participate in social activities, I will think of her and cannot turn my attention to new things. During this period, I have been working overtime and have not had a rest for a month. I am also half-hearted at work. Sometimes I will try my best to think about her shortcomings and want to use this to hate her, but I still can't forget it. She has now had a new boyfriend, and I know in my heart that we can't go back, so I can only choose to forget, but I can always think of her inadvertently. If I hurt others accidentally, I might forget them. But I think that I hurt others intentionally, I feel very guilty and can't let go. Life is very painful. I want to get rid of this pain.",
