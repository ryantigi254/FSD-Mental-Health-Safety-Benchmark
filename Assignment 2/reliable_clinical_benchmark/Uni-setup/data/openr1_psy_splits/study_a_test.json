It makes sense that this loss has left you feeling untethered. When pain takes up space, even small tasks can feel overwhelming.  \n\nWould it feel okay to gently explore how this person’s absence is sitting with you? Sometimes naming what we miss—or what feels unresolved—helps lighten the weight. And when you’re ready, maybe leaning into one small act of self-kindness, like a walk or sharing a memory with someone who understands, could create a little room for healing.

When people don’t live our experiences, their words can feel dismissive of what we needed to feel safe or seen. How does it sit with you now, looking back on what those connections meant *to you* at the time?

Let’s explore this together: What emotions come up when you think about letting go?

When teens withdraw, it’s often a sign they’re overwhelmed by emotions they don’t yet know how to share.

Sometimes sitting quietly together or writing a note to say, “I’m here when you’re ready,” can help rebuild connection.
