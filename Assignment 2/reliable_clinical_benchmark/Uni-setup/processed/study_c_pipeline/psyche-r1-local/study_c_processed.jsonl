The prazosin has shown some improvement but not complete resolution of the nightmares.\n- Sleep patterns: Sam leaves a small light on due to increased anxiety in darkness, and working part-time while frequently canceling shifts due to poor sleep.\n- Environmental triggers: Loud noises in the environment, such as footsteps, can cause significant anxiety and increased heart rate.\n- Social life: Friends invite Sam to social events, but they often feel unsafe attending due to lingering PTSD symptoms.\n- Therapy: Therapy sessions are challenging but provide a sense of understanding and support.\n- Treatment duration: Sam is uncertain about the appropriate length of time to remain on the current medication and therapy regimen.\n\nIn summary, Sam's PTSD treatment involves a combination of sertraline and prazosin, along with ongoing therapy.
