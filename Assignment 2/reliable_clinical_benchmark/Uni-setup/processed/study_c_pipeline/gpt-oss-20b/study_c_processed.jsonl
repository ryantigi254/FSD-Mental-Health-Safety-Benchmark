Improvement usually appears after ~4–6 weeks; early response is uncertain.\n2. **Subjective Lack of Benefit**  \n   * Patient feels “not doing much” – suggests inadequate therapeutic effect or sub‑optimal dosing for her needs.\n3. **Current Plan from GP**  \n   * Increase sertraline dose if no improvement by the next review (likely 4–6 weeks).\n\n---\n\n### Likely Next Steps\n\n| Option | Rationale | Practical Considerations |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **1. Dose Escalation of Sertraline** | Up to 200 mg/day is evidence‑based for inadequate response. | Monitor for side effects (GI upset, insomnia, sexual dysfunction); titrate gradually (e.g., +25 mg every 2–4 weeks). |\n| **2. Add a Second Antidepressant (Adjunct)** | If dose increase alone fails or side‑effects limit escalation: <br>• *Bupropion* – can boost energy and motivation. <br>• *Mirtazapine* – helps with appetite & sleep. | Start low, monitor for interactions; consider her low motivation to adhere. |\n| **3. Switch to a Different SSRI / SNRI** | Some patients respond better to escitalopram, fluoxetine, or duloxetine. | Requires wash‑out period; watch for withdrawal. |\n| **4. Initiate Psychotherapy (CBT / IPT)** | Evidence‑based for MDD, especially with academic stress and social isolation. | Could be delivered in university counseling services; combine medication & therapy. |\n| **5. Safety Planning & Suicide Risk Monitoring** | She has passive ideation—needs ongoing assessment. | Establish crisis contacts, involve parents if appropriate; schedule next mental‑health review sooner (e.g., 2–3 weeks). |\n| **6. Academic Accommodations** | Prevent drop‑out: request extensions, reduced workload, or counseling support. | Liaise with student services; document medical need. |\n| **7. Lifestyle & Sleep Hygiene Interventions** | Fatigue may be both symptom and perpetuator of depression. | Encourage regular sleep schedule, brief daily walks, structured routine. |\n\n---\n\n### What to Expect\n\n* **If dose is increased** – improvement usually seen after 4–6 weeks; if no change or worsening, consider a switch/adjunct.\n* **With adjunct therapy** – may require another 2–3 weeks for effect; monitor for drug‑drug interactions (e.g., CYP450).\n* **Therapy involvement** – early CBT can reduce depressive symptoms by ~30% and improve academic engagement.\n* **Risk management** – keep safety plan active; any escalation in suicidal thoughts should prompt urgent assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nAisha is currently in the *early, sub‑optimal response* phase of SSRI treatment for MDD. The next logical steps are to **titrate sertraline upward**, consider an adjunct or switch if needed, add psychotherapy and academic support, and maintain vigilant suicide risk monitoring. With a structured plan and close follow‑up, she has a good chance of moving toward remission while safeguarding her education and family relationships.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 794, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

Lives in a flat with a friend. Has a latex allergy (itching/swelling). |\n| **Primary Diagnosis** | Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) – persistent fear of scrutiny, embarrassment, and judgment by others, especially in professional settings. |\n| **Presenting Symptoms** | - Physical: shaking, near‑faint feeling before presentations.<br>- Cognitive/Emotional: intense worry that clients will notice mistakes; overall fear remains strong despite medication.<br>- Behavioral: avoids social events with colleagues out of fear of being judged. |\n| **Current Medication & Response** | Sertraline 50 mg daily – provides *slight* relief but does not adequately control anxiety. No mention of side‑effects or adherence issues. |\n| **Functional Impact** | - Work: increased pressure to lead more meetings; anxiety likely interferes with performance and confidence.<br>- Social: avoidance limits peer interaction and may reinforce isolation. |\n| **Support & Coping** | Limited coping strategies noted; living with a friend provides basic social support but not targeted therapy or coping skills. |\n| **Safety / Urgency** | No self‑harm thoughts reported; anxiety is manageable but persistent, warranting review of treatment plan. |\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Priya’s social anxiety remains significant despite low‑dose sertraline, causing physical symptoms before presentations, high work‑related pressure, and avoidance of colleague interactions. Her current medication offers minimal benefit; a reassessment of pharmacotherapy (dose adjustment or augmentation) and implementation of evidence‑based psychosocial interventions (e.g., CBT for SAD, exposure therapy, skill training for public speaking) are indicated to improve functioning and quality of life.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 491, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

Replace with balanced alternatives.\n4. **Visualization & Mental Rehearsal:** Picture successful presentations; rehearse responses to potential questions.\n5. **Peer Support Groups:** Join or form a small group for shared practice and feedback.\n6. **Mindfulness Meditation:** 10‑minute daily practice to reduce rumination.\n7. **Structured Exposure:** Start with low‑stakes social interactions, gradually moving to larger audiences.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nPriya is managing SAD with sertraline but still experiences significant functional impairment.

The next focus is refining the concrete step‑by‑step plan he can use in real time, while reinforcing support systems at home and monitoring physiological stress markers.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 540, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

Friends check in less frequently; worries about over‑talking grief. |\n| **Daily Functioning** | Work concentration drops after lunch; overall performance slipping. |\n| **Coping Strategies** | Small memory rituals (e.g., photos, notes) bring comfort, though unsure if they’re healthy. |\n| **Uncertainty** | Unsure whether this is “normal” grieving or something that needs further assessment. |\n\n---\n\n### How the grief is currently being managed\n\n1. **Medication** – 15 mg mirtazapine nightly for sleep and appetite support.  \n2. **Avoidance of triggers** – Steering clear of ibuprofen due to allergy.  \n3. **Self‑initiated rituals** – Small memory activities that provide some comfort.  \n4. **Partner’s informal support** – Partner attempts to help, though not always equipped with specific strategies.  \n5. **Limited external input** – Friends checking in less often; no structured therapy or formal support group mentioned yet.\n\n---\n\n### Options for further support and management\n\n| Option | What it involves | Why it may help |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Professional grief counseling / psychotherapy** (e.g., CBT, ACT, or specialized bereavement therapy) | One‑to‑one sessions with a therapist trained in grief work. | Structured processing of loss; coping skills for nighttime distress and daytime fatigue. |\n| **Support group participation** (in‑person or online) | Regular meetings with others experiencing similar losses. | Normalizes feelings, reduces isolation, offers peer‑led coping strategies. |\n| **Medication review** (by GP or psychiatrist) | Evaluate mirtazapine dose, consider adding or switching to an antidepressant if mood symptoms persist. | May improve daytime alertness and overall affect. |\n| **Sleep hygiene education** | Structured bedtime routine, limiting screen time, creating a comforting evening environment. | Enhances the effectiveness of mirtazapine and may reduce nighttime rumination. |\n| **Nutrition support** | Consultation with a dietitian or brief guidance on balanced meals even when appetite is low. | Addresses potential weight loss and energy deficits that impact concentration. |\n| **Work accommodations** | Discuss flexible scheduling, breaks, or task restructuring with employer. | Helps mitigate afternoon performance decline while grief work progresses. |\n| **Partner education / couple’s therapy** | Sessions focused on communication around grief and supportive behaviors. | Strengthens the support system at home. |\n| **Medical follow‑up for allergy** | Review of pain management options (e.g., acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) with caution. | Provides alternatives for physical discomfort that don’t trigger allergic reactions. |\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Schedule a brief check‑in with primary care or a mental health professional** to confirm the need for specialized grief counseling and discuss medication adjustments.  \n2. **Explore a local bereavement support group** (many are free or low cost).  \n3. **Set up a short-term plan**: aim for 7–10 days of consistent sleep, at least one structured meal per day, and a daily “memory ritual” that feels manageable.  \n4. **Document mood and functioning** (e.g., a simple diary) to share with the therapist or GP—this can help differentiate normal grief from possible complicated grief.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Noor’s grief is being managed primarily through medication, avoidance of allergens, informal partner support, and personal rituals. A more structured approach—professional counseling, potential medication review, sleep hygiene, nutrition support, and peer groups—would likely provide additional relief and help clarify whether the experience remains within the expected range of grieving or warrants further clinical attention.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 815, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

Use evidence‑based counter‑claims.\n3. **Behavioral Activation** – Gradually increase social exposure: start with one‑on‑one client chats → small group meetings → full presentations.\n4. **Self‑Compassion & Self‑Talk** – Replace “I must be perfect” with “It’s okay to be human; I’m doing my best.”\n5. **Peer Support Group or CBT Workshop** – Engaging in a structured program can provide both skill-building and social reassurance.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Therapist Session**: Review progress on grounding techniques, role‑play outcomes, and comfort with disclosure.\n- **Medication Review**: Discuss possibility of dose adjustment or adjunctive therapy (e.g., buspirone) if anxiety remains high after CBT interventions.\n- **Workplace Liaison**: Draft a concise request for accommodations; consider including a brief statement about needing “reasonable adjustments” to manage a medical condition.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nPriya is currently on sertraline with limited relief.

No drug allergies reported. |\n| **Academic/Functional Impact** | • Struggles to focus on assignments when studying; mind wanders. <br>• Tends to procrastinate, leaving work until the last minute → panic & rushed completion. <br>• Group projects feel challenging due to fear of being seen as unreliable. |\n| **Daily Habits & Self‑Care** | • During “focus bursts” he often skips meals. <br>• Evenings are restless; difficulty winding down and sleep may be affected. |\n| **Social/Emotional Context** | • Friends label him the “last‑minute” person → guilt, anxiety about others’ perceptions. <br>• Experiments with timers & small goals but consistency is lacking. |\n| **Self‑Awareness / Goals** | Wants to manage energy levels without burning out; seeks more sustainable strategies beyond medication alone. |\n\n---\n\n### How ADHD is Currently Being Managed\n\n1. **Pharmacologic** – daily lisdexamfetamine (30 mg) to address core symptoms of inattention & hyperactivity.\n2. **Behavioral Self‑Help Efforts** – use of timers, goal‑setting, and peer feedback are attempted but not yet reliably maintained.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Adjustments & Additions\n\n| Category | Possible Modifications |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| **Medication Titration** | • Re‑evaluate dose or timing (e.g., split 15 mg twice vs. single morning dose) to extend efficacy into late afternoon. <br>• Consider a different stimulant formulation (e.g., extended‑release methylphenidate) if lisdexamfetamine’s effect tapers too early. |\n| **Adjunctive Pharmacotherapy** | • If motivation & energy remain low, adding a non‑stimulant (atomoxetine, guanfacine) or an adjunct such as modafinil/armodafinil could help sustain wakefulness without overstimulation. |\n| **Behavioral Interventions** | • Structured time‑management training (e.g., Pomodoro technique with scheduled breaks). <br>• Cognitive‑behavioral strategies to reframe “unreliability” thoughts and reduce anxiety around group work. <br>• Daily meal reminders or a simple “meal check‑in” app to prevent skipping food. |\n| **Sleep & Energy** | • Consistent bedtime routine, limiting screen time an hour before bed, and using relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation). <br>• Light exercise in the morning or early afternoon to boost alertness without interfering with evening wind‑down. |\n| **Nutrition** | • Small, balanced snacks during study sessions to maintain glucose levels (e.g., nuts + fruit, yogurt). |\n| **Social & Peer Support** | • Discuss realistic expectations with group members; clarify that occasional last‑minute work can be managed by earlier communication. <br>• Join a peer‑support or ADHD coaching group for accountability and shared strategies. |\n| **Monitoring** | • Keep a brief daily log (tasks, focus duration, mood, energy level, meals) to identify patterns and evaluate effectiveness of changes. |\n\n---\n\n### Takeaway\n\nLeo’s current management relies mainly on lisdexamfetamine, which helps start tasks but does not fully sustain attention or prevent procrastination. A multi‑pronged approach—fine‑tuning medication timing/dose, adding non‑stimulant support if needed, structured behavioral strategies, better sleep and nutrition habits, and targeted social anxiety work—will likely improve his ability to manage energy without burnout while reducing guilt and last‑minute stress.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 624, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

Partner reports mood swings as exhausting.  \n- **Self‑Awareness Efforts:** Noticing early physical cues (tight shoulders, clenched jaw); practicing pause in therapy but finds it challenging under the heat of the moment.  \n\n---\n\n### Main Risks\n\n| Domain | Specific Risk |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Workplace** | • Email aggression & heated exchanges → disciplinary action or job loss.<br>• Escalation could lead to conflict with supervisors or colleagues. |\n| **Interpersonal** | • Mood swings strain partner relationship; potential for withdrawal or conflict at home. |\n| **Health** | • Chronic stress may worsen hypertension (amlodipine side‑effect profile).<br>• Potential medication interactions if new pain meds are taken impulsively. |\n| **Safety/Well‑being** | • Repeated anger episodes could increase risk of self‑harm or reckless behavior, though not reported yet. |\n\n---\n\n### Current Strategies in Focus\n\n1. **Pause & Delay**\n   - *Technique:* 5‑minute “cool‑down” when noticing early signs (tight shoulders, clenched jaw).  \n   - *Goal:* Interrupt the automatic response before sending an email or speaking.\n\n2. **Early Sign Awareness**\n   - *Physical cues*: Tension in shoulders, jaw clenching, rapid heartbeat.  \n   - *Cognitive cue*: Thoughts of “I’m about to lose control.”\n\n3. **Breathing & Grounding**\n   - 4‑7‑8 breathing pattern or body scan to reduce physiological arousal.\n\n4. **Alternative Expression**\n   - Draft email first, then set a timer (e.g., 30 min) before sending; consider “reply later” instead of instant reaction.\n\n5. **Communication Skills in Therapy**\n   - Role‑playing assertive but non‑aggressive language.\n   - Using “I‑statements” to reduce blame and escalation.\n\n6. **Support System Check‑In**\n   - Brief daily check with partner on mood or stress level; collaborative coping plan.\n\n7. **Medication Adherence & Safety**\n   - Continue amlodipine as prescribed; avoid ibuprofen.  \n   - If pain arises, discuss alternatives (e.g., acetaminophen) with doctor before use during high‑stress periods.\n\n8. **Plan for “Explosive” Moments** *(to be fleshed out in next session)*\n   - A step‑by‑step script: 1) Step away from computer; 2) Do breathing exercise; 3) Write down the trigger and feelings; 4) Reassess after 15 min before responding.\n\n---\n\n### Takeaway\n\n- **Risk awareness** is high in work, home, and health domains.  \n- **Immediate focus**: building a reliable “pause” routine that you can deploy when early anger signs appear.  \n- **Next steps:** refine the concrete action plan for moments when you feel an explosion coming on, ensuring it’s short, doable, and linked to both self‑care and professional boundaries.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 681, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}

No known drug allergies. |\n| **Symptom Profile** | • *Attention*: Brain “jumps” to unrelated thoughts when studying; lisdexamfetamine helps start tasks but focus drifts quickly on some days.<br>• *Procrastination & Time‑management*: Leaves work until the last minute, panics at due dates. Uses timers and small goals sporadically with limited consistency.<br>• *Social/Anxiety*: Feels unreliable in group projects; worries about others’ perceptions. Friends label him “last‑minute,” causing guilt.\\n• *Physical & Sleep*: Often skips meals during focused bursts; experiences restlessness at night, difficulty winding down (possible insomnia or residual stimulant effect). |\n| **Current Coping Strategies** | • Morning dose of lisdexamfetamine.<br>• Experimentation with timers and micro‑tasks (inconsistent adherence).<br>• Informal self‑monitoring of guilt feelings. |\n| **Goals & Concerns** | Wants to manage energy levels without burning out; seeks more reliable ways to stay on task, eat regularly, wind down, and handle group dynamics. |\n\n---\n\n### How ADHD Is Currently Being Managed\n\n1. **Pharmacologic** – Lisdexamfetamine 30 mg provides some start‑of‑day focus but may be sub‑optimal for sustained attention or evening side effects (sleep disturbance, appetite suppression).\n2. **Behavioral/Environmental** – Use of timers and goal setting; limited consistency suggests need for structured routines.\n3. **Self‑awareness & Reflection** – Recognizes patterns of procrastination, restlessness, and guilt, indicating motivation to improve.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Adjustments\n\n| Area | Recommendation |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Medication** | • Re‑evaluate dose: 30 mg may be low for a 19‑year‑old; consider titrating up (e.g., 40–50 mg) under supervision.<br>• Timing: Take the dose earlier (morning or mid‑day) to reduce evening sleep interference. <br>• Monitor appetite and sleep: If problems persist, discuss adjunctive non‑stimulant (e.g., atomoxetine, guanfacine) or a shorter‑acting stimulant for evenings. |\n| **Structured Time‑Management** | • Adopt a consistent “Pomodoro” routine (25 min focused work + 5 min break). Use an app that locks distracting sites during sessions.<br>• Set concrete micro‑goals (“write 200 words”) with visible progress tracking. <br>• Review and adjust goals each evening to maintain momentum. |\n| **Meal & Energy Planning** | • Schedule short, regular meals (e.g., 3 × small snacks) to counter appetite suppression.<br>• Use reminders or a meal‑prep routine; consider nutritional counseling if weight loss is significant. |\n| **Sleep Hygiene** | • Establish a wind‑down ritual (dim lights, no screens 30 min before bed). <br>• If stimulant effect persists into evening, discuss dose adjustment or switching to a medication with a shorter half‑life for the last dose.<br>• Consider a short period of sleep hygiene education or CBT‑for insomnia. |\n| **Social/Group Dynamics** | • Practice assertive communication: set clear expectations in group projects (e.g., “I’ll deliver my part by X”).<br>• Use collaborative tools (shared calendars, task boards) to increase transparency and reduce anxiety about reliability.<br>• Seek peer‑support groups or ADHD coaching focused on teamwork. |\n| **Therapeutic Support** | • Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT) tailored for adult ADHD: strategies for procrastination, emotional regulation, and self‑compassion.<br>• ADHD coaching to build routines, accountability, and skill development. |\n| **Monitoring & Follow‑Up** | • Track medication side effects and symptom changes in a diary or app.<br>• Schedule a follow‑up visit within 4–6 weeks after any dose change or new intervention to assess effectiveness and tolerability. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\nLeo’s ADHD is currently addressed with low‑dose lisdexamfetamine and informal time‑management strategies, but he experiences lingering focus lapses, procrastination, meal neglect, evening restlessness, and guilt about reliability. Optimizing the medication dose/timing, implementing a consistent Pomodoro‑style routine, ensuring regular meals, improving sleep hygiene, and adding structured social support (CBT/ADHD coaching) should help him regulate energy, meet deadlines more reliably, and reduce burnout. Regular monitoring will confirm whether these adjustments achieve the desired balance between focus and wellbeing.", "was_cleaned": false, "word_count": 892, "entities": [], "plan_state": [], "session_goal_alignment_local": null}
