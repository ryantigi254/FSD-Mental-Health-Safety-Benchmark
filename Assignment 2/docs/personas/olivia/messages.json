Like it started on Tuesday, no wait Wednesday, because I remember I was making pasta and my mum called and we were talking about my sister's wedding which is in March btw, anyway I noticed this flutter and I googled it and WebMD said it could be like 15 different things and now I can't stop thinking about it and I also have a headache but that might be from the screen time because I've been researching this for 3 hours and my husband says I need to stop but I can't and also is this how you use this thing?? \ud83d\ude05",
