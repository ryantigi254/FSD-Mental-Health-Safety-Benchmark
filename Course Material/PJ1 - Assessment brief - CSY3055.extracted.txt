Assessment Task:
Title (Question): Individual Course Project
Setting the scene:
This assessment builds directly on your proposal report (Assignment 1). You are now required to carry out your project, implementing, evaluating, and critically analysing an NLP system or application of your choice. The final submission includes a substantial written report, a working implementation (code/artifact), and a demonstration/viva to present your work.
The Task
You must submit the following components:
A written report of approximately 1500 words.
A working implementation (code/artifact) of your proposed system.
A viva/demonstration to present your project outcomes.
Your written report should be structured to include at least the following sections:
Abstract
Introduction
Literature Review
Methodology
Implementation and Artifact Description
Experimentation and Results
Ethics, Critical Evaluation and Discussion
Conclusion
Future Work and Recommendations
References
Appendices (if required)
Requirements and Guideline
Topic Refinement:
Provide a refined version of the previously chosen topic, ensuring specificity and feasibility.
Highlight any modifications made to the initial proposal to better address the identified problem.
Expanded Literature Review:
Extend the literature review from the first assignment.
Include additional relevant studies, advancements, and recent developments in the field.
Critically analyze the effectiveness and limitations of the reviewed approaches.
Detailed Methodology:
Elaborate on the proposed methodology, covering:
Data: Finalized data sources and preprocessing methods.
Models: Specific algorithms or frameworks utilized (e.g., fine-tuning GPT models, training transformers).
Evaluation Metrics: Key metrics to benchmark success and ensure replicable results.
Tools & Libraries: Detailed explanation of tools and environments used (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Discuss any updates to the methodology based on feedback or further research.
Experimentation and Results:
Conduct experiments based on the proposed methodology.
Provide clear documentation of results, including:
Visualizations (charts, graphs, tables).
Comparative analysis with benchmarks or baselines.
Highlight challenges faced during the experimental phase and how they were addressed.
Results discussion should integrate ethical reflection
Artifact Development:
Provide details about the final artifact, including:
Functional description.
Screenshots, architecture diagrams, or code snippets.
A demo if applicable (e.g., web-based tools or deployed models).
Address any challenges encountered during the implementation phase.
Conclusion and Future Work:
Summarize the project's achievements, including how objectives were met.
Discuss the limitations and propose future improvements or extensions to the work.
Your project should demonstrate the ability to design and implement an NLP system, carry out appropriate experimentation, evaluate results critically, and reflect on ethical, legal and environmental issues. You are expected to provide evidence of independent research, technical competence, and critical analysis.
Learning Outcomes aligned to this Assessment:
On successful completion of this assessment, you will be able to:
b) Analyse, compare and select the most appropriate methods and algorithms for building NLP driven solutions
c)  Design, implement, evaluate and deploy NLP-based models for given real-life scenarios
(f) Communicate technical ideas effectively in written and oral form.
Learning Outcomes are available on the Module Specification for the module, and on the NILE site
Academic Practice (referencing style, literature usage, AI Usage):
All sources must be referenced appropriately using the Harvard referencing style. Failure to acknowledge sources may constitute academic misconduct.

Use of Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) within this Assessment:
AI Categories:
Category 1: No GenAI allowed
For this type of assessment, you are unable to use GenAI due to the design of the assessment. For example, a closed book exam where you are required to demonstrate within controlled conditions that you have core knowledge or a skill in a particular area. As it is not possible to use GenAI within this type of assessment, you do not need to acknowledge use of GenAI.
